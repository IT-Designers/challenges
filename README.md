# ITD-Challenge Platform

![IT-Designers Gruppe Logo](./docs/images/it-designers-logo.jpg)

This repository contains the documentation, source code, helpers, and a rudimentary configuration for the challenge platform:

- **src** This folder contains the dotnet v3.1 project.
- **docs** This folder contains the project documentation, e.g.
  - the developer guide in [dev_guide.md](./docs/dev_guide.md)
  - the requirement documentation in [requirements.md](./docs/requirements.md)
  - the architecture documentation in [arc42.md](./docs/arc42.md)
- **web** This folder contains a minimal set of settings and challenge data to execute the challenge platform.  
  In addition, all used third party tools/frameworks/libs licenses are [referenced](./web/_help/third-party-notices.md).
